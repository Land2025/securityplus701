# Threat Actors- Nation State, Unskilled attacker, Hacktivist, Insider threat, Organized crime, Shadow IT
### Nation State- use various methods to compromise security and gain access to victim networks
### Unskilled attacker- an individual with very limited technical knowledge or hacking skills who typically relies on readily available tools and scripts to launch attacks, lacking the ability to develop their own sophisticated exploits or techniques
### Hacktivist- believe that they are affecting positive social change and feel justified in targeting individuals, organizations or government agencies to expose secrets or other sensitive information
### Insider threat- threats that originate with authorized users, such as employees, contractors and business partners, who intentionally or accidentally misuse their legitimate access, or have their accounts hijacked by cybercriminals
### Organized crime-  individuals or groups that use cyberattacks to steal data and make it inaccessible for ransom
### Shadow IT- employees within an organization who unknowingly create security vulnerabilities by using unauthorized software, applications, or devices without the knowledge or approval of the IT department
# Attributes of actors
### Internal/external- their level of access to the organization's systems and their insider knowledge
### Resources/funding- Well-funded threat actors can afford to invest in sophisticated tools, zero-day exploits, and advanced infrastructure to carry out their attacks
### Level of sophistication/capability- technical skill, complexity of tools used, and ability to evade detection displayed by an attacker
# Motivation- Data exfiltration, Espionage, Service disruption, Blackmail, Financial gain, Philosophical/political beliefs, Ethical, Revenge, Disruption/chaos, War
### Data exfilitration- exfiltrating sensitive data before encrypting systems and threatening to release the stolen information unless a ransom is paid.
### Espionage-Nation-state actors frequently exfiltrate data to gain intelligence on competitors or adversaries, acquiring sensitive government information or trade secrets
### Service disruption- aim to disrupt critical infrastructure, services, or operations for political or ideological reasons
### Blackmail- taking something to later use that against them
### Financial gain-This is the most common motive, with cybercriminals often selling stolen data on the dark web or using it for extortion through ransomware attacks.
### Philosophical/political beliefs- driven by political, social, or ideological cause
### Ethical-While financial gain is a common motivation, threat actors can also be driven by political agendas, personal vendettas, thrill-seeking, or simply causing disruption
### Revenge- Disgruntled employees may exfiltrate data to get revenge on their employer
### Disruption/chaos- an individual or group who actively seeks to disrupt systems, create instability
### War-typically aim to disrupt critical infrastructure, gather intelligence through espionage, or cause significant damage to a nation's systems
